# ProgressGML95
</div>

Crappy [Progressbar95](https://www.spookyhousestudios.com/s/2021/09/21/progressbar95-retro-arcade/) clone in GameMaker that i made for fun.

## Download

You can download the game [here](https://github.com/RealMCoded/ProgressGML95/releases). I release an update whenever i want, there is no fixed times for when i update.

## Why do i require a copy of Progressbar95 to play?

This is to prevent copyright issues. So instead of me cloning the Progressbar95 sprites, the game loads them from Progressbar95's install directory.

## Building

To build, you need to use the newest version of GameMaker. My main target is for Windows, but other desktop targets should work as well.

Download/clone this repository and open it with GameMaker Studio 2 and press "Run".
